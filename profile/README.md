# Tegonal Cooperative

The tegonal team develops high quality software. We base our activity whenever possible on Open Source technology and we try to activly participate and commit to a number of projects, libraries and tools. 

Here is a selection of Open Source Projects we are currently working on:

- 👩‍🌾 [OpenOlitor](https://github.com/openolitor): We are co-initiators of the overall solution for community supported agricultere initiatives, Solawi and all subscription-based food distributors. The web application enables users to easily manage hundreds of subscriptions. From delivery planning to invoicing, everything is handled via OpenOlitor and subscribers can plan their absences via the customer portal.

- 🪴 [Open Food Network Switzerland](https://www.openfoodswitzerland.ch): The open web platform for food distribution. We are part of an active international community, operate the platform for the OFN Switzerland association and ensure that it is adapted to the Swiss environment.

- 🦦 [Untendurch](https://github.com/prolutra/untendurch): Design and implementation of the platform for the Pro Lutra association for mapping bridges and checking them for "otter friendliness".

- 🔍 [Metabase Teradata driver](https://github.com/swisscom-bigdata/metabase-teradata-driver): We maintain the Teradata driver implemented in Clojure for Swisscom and the Metabase community.
